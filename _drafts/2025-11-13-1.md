Heyo, Sirkorgo here!

So Valve just announced their new hardware, and I am STOKED. They announced a refreshed Steam Controller, a VR Headset, and probably the best valued gaming PC.

### Steam Frame (The VR Headset)
I'm gonna talk about Steam's VR Headset first because it's a standalone VR Headset that DOESN'T run on ANDROID!!!! Personally, I'm overly excited over this since Meta Quests are like... the only other good standalone VR headsets out there, but they're bloated with metaverse junk, which I hate. Also Meta Quests run on Android, which is really unstable to use on VR headsets.

Steam Frame is JUST a PC in the form a VR Headset. I've seen a few reviews of it, and I'm really excited because it allegedly runs really well, and with Proton, basically a program by Valve to run Windows games, PCVR games run flawlessly with any VR Steam games someone might have.

That's all from me, see ya!
