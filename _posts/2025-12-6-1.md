Heyo, Sirkorgo here!

So Valve just announced their new hardware, and I am STOKED. They announced a refreshed Steam Controller, a VR Headset, and probably the best valued gaming PC.

### Steam Frame (The VR Headset)
I'm gonna talk about Steam's VR Headset first because it's a standalone VR Headset that DOESN'T run on ANDROID!!!! Personally, I'm overly excited over this since Meta Quests are like... the only other good standalone VR headsets out there, despite it being incredibly unstable and laggy, while also bloated with metaverse junk, which I really hate.

Steam Frame is JUST a PC in the form a VR Headset. I've seen a few reviews of it, and I'm really excited because it allegedly runs really well, and with Proton, basically a program by Valve to run Windows games, PCVR games run flawlessly with any VR Steam games someone might have.

ooh, the VR Adapter that's ***INCLUDED*** with the Steam Frame is really sick. Full PCVR with ultra optimized wireless streamign!

overall, i REALLY wanna try out the Steam Frame, but I just don't play VR games enough to get it, and I dont feel like re-purchashing

### Steam Machine (The Home Console/Mini PC)
The Steam Machine looks **REALLY** good for what it is. It's a whole PC designed for gaming on the big screen but in the size of a handheld. The specs of the device look really good and I *WANT* it, but I think getting a Steam Deck would be better for my needs? Not much to say here, i suppose?

### Steam Controller (cardinal's secret crush)
ok so, the steam controller isn't very appealing to me, but its definitely a LOT better than the original steam controller. oh and cardinal LOVES this thing.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ghl7KJHxhtI">one of the videos cardinal made on this thing</a>
ironically cardinal basically predicted the new controller which is really funny :3

mjv2011 channel plug here because he asked me so kindly 🐟 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mjv2011">youtube.com/@mjv2011</a>

the controller puck is a really cool idea and it just seems so HANDY!!! again, same with the Steam Frame, I don't really need it, I already have a PS4 controller that works fine for when I occasionally play Just Shapes & Beats...

but yeah, the new Valve hardware all look awesome, while I don't need it, I would LOVE to have it.

That's all from me, see ya!
