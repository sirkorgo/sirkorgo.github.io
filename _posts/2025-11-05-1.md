Heyo, Sirkorgo here!

Recently, I've been obbessing over vocaloid music, ya know, Hatsune Miku, Kasane Teto, Kagamine Len/Rin.
Anyways, every other year I believe, there is this miku concert thing called Miku Expo. Miku Expo is like I said, a Hatsune Miku concert. In previous concerts Miku would appear on stage using laser projections, and it would look really cool, or so I've heard. But recently, they have just been showing Miku on a LCD display, not as fancy, but.. it works I guess, still really fun lol.

I happened to check the Miku Expo website at the perfect time. As it turns out, ticket purchasing opens in a few days (as of when I checked the site), so I asked my good friend, @mjv2011, who has a whole ass SHELF for Miku figures/plushes/etc. Obviously, he said yes, and we managed to snag some tickets. I am... REALLY excited. I've like... NEVER been to a concert before, and Miku Expo being my first one is gonna so freaking cool.

I'll probably post about the concert itself when I go, but the concert itself is in APRIL 2026.
WHY DO THEY HAVE TICKET OPENINGS THIS EARLY?!?!?!?!?!?!

That's all from me, see ya!
