Heyo, Sirkorgo here!
<br>

My good friend Sharky got me hooked on Dandadan (which is like... REALLY good) and One Piece (unfortunately), but the story of both series are really good.

### Dandadan
Dandadan is a Manga series about ghosts and aliens. Not really sure how I should sum up the story without giving major spoilers, but if you're into Sci-Fi, action, and a tad bit of romance, the series is for you!

I started watching the anime version of Dandadan after a deal I made with Sharky. I wasn't that interested in the anime but then I just got addicted to it. A short bit after finishing the anime, I found out that theres more of the story in the Manga. So I stopped by my local Barnes & Noble and picked up a few volumes following the anime! (specifically the 9th and 10th volumes..) <img src="/src/post/2025-12-6-2/manga.png" width="190" height="264" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;">

Anyways, getting manga is SO. EXPENSIVE. 😭 like, I see WHY its $10 a pop cuz Manga takes forever, then they gotta translate it, but I wish it wasn't as expensive since I prefer reading manga physically rather than online...

### One Piece
oh my, sharky is gonna LOVE this section of the post<br>
um yeah I did NOT want to get into One Piece because its just... SO DAMN LONG!!!! THERES LIKE 100 VOLUMES?!!?!!?

sharky has been begging me to read One Piece for a year now, and I just decided, meh, ill get the first volume along with Dandadan. and you know what? its not bad! i like the story so far, but holy crap the characters a tad bit annoying. i dont wanna get all the volumes (because yes, i prefer physical...) but i think once i finish up the 3 in 1s i got for the first 6 volumes ill get a Shonen Jump subscription, which is like $4 for basically every popular manga. (shonen jump is a publisher for manga, i think?) lowkey that's a really nice deal, so like i said ill try to read manga online for the sake of saving money 🤑.
